INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY
Credit History Application
Effective Date: December 14, 2025
================================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the information security policy for the Credit History 
Application, a stateless financial data aggregation platform. The policy 
establishes security requirements, controls, and procedures to identify, 
mitigate, and monitor information security risks.

Our security approach prioritizes data protection through encryption, zero 
persistent storage, and continuous monitoring.

================================================================================

2. SCOPE

This policy applies to:
- All production systems and applications
- Development environments
- Third-party integrations (Plaid API)
- Personnel with access to systems or data
- All data handling and storage practices

================================================================================

3. SECURITY OBJECTIVES

- Protect user financial data from unauthorized access
- Maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all systems
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and FCRA requirements
- Prevent data breaches through encryption and zero-storage architecture
- Monitor and detect security threats
- Respond quickly to security incidents

================================================================================

4. SECURITY CONTROLS

4.1 ENCRYPTION & DATA PROTECTION

Token Encryption:
- All Plaid access tokens encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption
- Encryption keys stored as environment variables (never in code)
- Tokens stored only in httpOnly session cookies
- Tokens not logged or exposed in error messages

Data At Rest:
- No persistent customer financial data stored
- Session-only data lifecycle
- httpOnly cookies prevent JavaScript access
- Secure flag enforces HTTPS-only transmission

Data In Transit:
- All network traffic uses HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
- Plaid API calls encrypted
- Browser-server communication encrypted
- No unencrypted data transmission

4.2 AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS CONTROL

User Authentication:
- Plaid Link for secure bank account authentication
- Session-based authentication with encrypted tokens
- Session timeout: 24 hours
- Token expiry enforcement on all API operations

API Security:
- Token-based authentication for all endpoints
- No hardcoded credentials (environment variables only)
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Input validation on all requests

4.3 INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY

- Row-level security filters on all queries

Compliance:
- GDPR compliant (no data storage)
- CCPA compliant (user can delete session anytime)
- FCRA-aware (credit data handling)
- PCI DSS aligned (token encryption)

4.8 ENDPOINT SECURITY

Production Assets:
- Render.com container-based infrastructure
- Immutable deployments (no persistent state)
- Automated security patching
- No mutable server instances
- Centralized secret management

Development Machines:
- MacOS with Gatekeeper and XProtect enabled
- Automatic security updates
- Firewall enabled
- SSH keys for authentication
- No stored API credentials

BYOD Policy:
- Currently not permitted
- Will implement MDM when team scales
- Mandatory encryption required
- Two-factor authentication enforced
- Remote wipe capability
